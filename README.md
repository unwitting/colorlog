# Colorlog - memories in color

Colorlog is a novel approach to travel logging, journalling and the storage
of emotional memories. It allows you to put together palettes of one to five
colors that represent a thing, a place, a person, a time... Instead of carefully
recording every moment of a trip, give yourself the freedom to recreate
memories from something more primal. Small amounts of text can be used to
describe colors to people that you share with.

It can also be used as a piece of design. Create and share beautiful color
schemes.
